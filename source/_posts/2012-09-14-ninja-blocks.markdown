First official week on the job with the Ninja's of Blocks. Came in during an interesting time with both Dan and Pete away at TechCrunch's Disrupt conference and the new wordpress site requiring some love due to increased buzz around the blocks. Was great though to work through things without the so called hand-holding that most new recruits go through - there's just opportunity for lessons learned that formal training just doesn't provide.

Anyway, a jack of all trade's kind of week to sum it up really and I leave it with the following on my mind.

1. iTerm2 Rocks! Learnt some new tricks too ... (⌘+D to split window vertically, ⌘+⇧+D splits windows horizontally)
2. I love returning to the command line. Learnt some new tricks courtesy of Marcus (⌘+D to split)
3. How cool is the ```screen``` command!
4. WordPress can be difficult at times.
5. Why does cloudfront return Access Denied when you invalidate a file/path for it to be refreshed. I'm never sure if I'm going to leave a site in the ditches.
6. Of all the frontend frameworks to choose from which one shall I choose to build the Cloud on?

Have a great weekend!
