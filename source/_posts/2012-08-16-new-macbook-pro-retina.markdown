For the past week I have been setting up my new Macbook Pro Retina and loving every aspect of it. Rebooting is lightning quick, so fast that I don't feel I have time to get distracted - a good thing! The display is super hi-res (I run at the equivalent 1920x1200 resolution - a must for developers I think) and I find myself critiquing apps/websites that aren't retina enabled.

Now looking for a suitable sleeve/case/bag to carry it around in. Any recommendations?
